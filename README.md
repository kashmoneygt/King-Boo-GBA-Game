King Boo's Dirty Little Secret:
by Kashyap Patel

Ghosts are supposed to scare humans. That's all there is to ghost logic. 
They scare humans. It's as simple as that.

However, King Boo is a different type of ghost.
He is ironically scared of humans.
And you know what? THAT'S OKAY.

Show him that it's okay to be scared of humans by dodging the humans surrounding King Boo.

You can move King Boo around using the arrow keys!

Pressing SELECT will take the game to the title screen. It will NOT give the player an option
to reset; it will just reset. 

See how far you can take King Boo before the humans overwhelm him!

Side note: I made King Boo during Lab 17, and I decided to use that. 
Sorry for the very pixelated version of Boo.
